            <h2>Knowing Brothers</h2>

            <p class="main-text"> Currently enjoying an average weekly viewership rating of 5 – 6 %, considered high for a cable channel, 아는 형님 internationally known as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnQRgFY_BZzINo8IgW8HCHA" target="_blank" ><strong><em>Men on a Mission</em></strong></a>” or ” Ask us Anything” was able to save itself from shutting down and being a total failure. The show managed to soar with popularity not only locally but also in the international variety scene and is currently at the forefront of variety programs in South Korea.<br> The show has become a major stopover for idol groups making a comeback and celebrities promoting their new dramas and movies so many might have stumbled upon an episode clip of one of their favorite artists guesting on the show and found the show entertaining so they decided to watch more.</p>

            <h2>Aiyu</h2>

            <p class="main-text"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3SyT4_WLHzN7JmHQwKQZww" target="_blank"><strong><em>Lee Ji-eun</em></strong></a>  (Korean: 이지은; born May 16, 1993), known professionally as IU (Korean: 아이유), is a South Korean singer-songwriter and actress. She signed with Kakao M (formerly LOEN Entertainment) in 2007 as a trainee and debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with her album, Lost and Found. Although her follow-up albums, Growing Up and IU...IM, brought mainstream success, it was after the release of "Good Day" (Korean: 좋은 날), the lead single from her 2010 album Real, that she achieved national stardom. "Good Day" went on to spend five consecutive weeks at the top position of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, and in 2019 it was ranked number one on Billboard magazine's 100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s.</p>
